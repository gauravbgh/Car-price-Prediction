# Car-price-Prediction

This is a very basic regression problem where the problem asked us to predict the car price. The data consists of several features like brand, engine size, drive wheel etc.

The crisp here is to understand the VIF and P value and leverage them to understand which variables are important for the prediction. 

The code includes regression models using statsmodel and then thoroughly reviewing all the feature variables importance.
